# WeatherApp

I decided to start this project as a means to get experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript in a fun and interactive manner. Currently, the program displays the current
weather of whereever you are situated (if you allow the website to know your location). It also tells you current weather in a specific city of your choosing. This was
done by the assistance of the openweather API. Initially, I just had the "Enter a city" search bar but I quickly found out that this could cause problems if there are 2
countries that have the same city names.As a result, I decided to implement to a search bar where the user can input their desired country's 2-letter country code. There
are still some bugs that need to be fixed but this is roughly what it is going to look like. I also plan on adding more features such as a hourly forecast, 7 day
forecast and potentially some alerts.

## Things I learned

- Basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript
- How to make API calls
- How to work with data in JSON format
- This was also my first real project where I uploaded to GitHub so I had to learn Git and all of its respective commands
